>> Weather application

>> Allow users to input a city they would like to have weather data on. Used a weatherAPI from https://openweathermap.org/.
>> 
>> Struggled with finding how to search for a city using an input and submit button, and converting that search to the Longitude and Latitude to input into the URL from the API.
>>
>> Possibly could have had a drop down of cities to choose from, however a search is the goal.
